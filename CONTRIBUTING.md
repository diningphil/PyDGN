# Request a new PyDGN feature

You can request a new feature by:

- Going to the [Issues](https://github.com/diningphil/PyDGN/issues) section
- Opening a new issue and select the `Feature Request` option
- Be as detailed as possible in the description of the feature request, trying to suggest how we should implement it if you already have an idea.

Please remember that our goal is not to add new models or datasets to the library, rather to extend it to be as flexible as possible, so that we can use it for a larger number of research scenarios.

# Add new code to PyDGN

If you want to contribute to the development of PyDGN, please feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/diningphil/PyDGN/pulls) describing:

- what is the reason for the changes / new feature - why you think it is useful
- how well is your code documented (we'd like to keep 100% documentation percentage)
- which tests you have implemented to check the correct functioning of your code
- a simple example using the new feature (you can store data/model configurations in the `examples` folder)
